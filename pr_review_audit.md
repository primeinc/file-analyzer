# PR Review Audit Report

## Overview

This report documents the actions taken to address all review comments on PR #1: "Add robust JSON validation for vision model output".

## Summary of Changes

### 1. Fixed Documentation Consistency Issues

- **README.md**: Added "markdown" to `--vision-format` options list to align with implementation in analyze.sh and file_analyzer.py
- **test_data/run_tests.sh**: Fixed glob pattern for files with spaces to ensure correct matching of search result files

### 2. Improved JSON Handling

- **json_utils.py**: 
  - Completely rewrote the JSON extraction logic to properly handle nested objects, escaped quotes, and special characters
  - Implemented a multi-strategy approach for more robust extraction
  - Fixed attempt count tracking to record actual attempts made rather than max retry limit

- **fastvlm_json.py**: 
  - Implemented consistent error handling with JSONParsingError exception
  - Added custom error class with context information for debugging
  - Improved error metadata for better diagnostics

### 3. Added Comprehensive Tests

- **test_json_extraction.py**: Created unit tests for JSON extraction covering:
  - Nested objects
  - Multiple JSON objects in text
  - Malformed JSON
  - Escaped quotes
  - Special characters
  - Large JSON objects
  - Real-world model output scenarios

- **test_json_error_handling.py**: Added tests for error handling to verify:
  - Exception raising for failed parsing
  - Proper error metadata
  - Consistent error reporting

### 4. Added GitHub Workflow Documentation

- **CLAUDE.md**: Updated with detailed instructions on how to properly:
  - Create PR reviews
